Hello everyone, now I show you is based on C865 picture text recognition development kit 1.0 version. The app can recognize the text in the picture taken by the camera and display it on the APP. Let's introduce my demo scenario. Firstly, THE IP Camera and C865 are connected in the same LAN, and the IP Camera takes a still photo every 2 seconds. The C865 connects to the display through HDMI, and the C865 obtains the video stream from the IP Camera through RTSP protocol to display the original image and enhanced resolution image.
To launch the demo, open the application and click Settings to add the RTSP video stream. Now we can see that the German content in the picture is displayed on the app. All right, that's the end of the demo.
